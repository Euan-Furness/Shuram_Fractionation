This git repository contains the Python code and empirical data associated with Furness & Mitchell, "Photosynthetic fractionation of carbon: a biological driver for the Neoproterozoic Shuram carbon isotope excursion".

Empirical datasets are derived from existing publications:
* Fike et al. (2006). "Oxidation of the Ediacaran ocean"
* Tahata et al. (2013). "Carbon and oxygen isotope chemostratigraphies of the Yangtze platform, South China: decoding temperature and environmental changes through the Ediacaran"
* Kikumoto et al. (2014). "Nitrogen isotope chemostratigraphy of the Ediacaran and Early Cambrian platform sequence at Three Gorges, South China"

Python code is written in Spyder 5.4.3.

Simulation sets can be run using the Genetic_Algorithm_Sets.py script. Individual carbonate and organic carbon records can be pulled from the output of Genetic_Algorithm_Sets.py using Create_Time_Series.py.
